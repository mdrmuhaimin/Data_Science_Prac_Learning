    "Statistics play a vital role in data science for (at least) two reasons. First, it can be used to gain a deep understanding of data. This process is known as **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. Second, it can be used to infer the relationship between a sample and the population. This process is known as **inference**. In this assignment, you will learn about EDA and statistical inference through the analysis of a very interesting dataset - [property tax report data](http://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/propertyTax.htm). Specifically, you will learn the followings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Be able to perform EDA on a single column (i.e., univariate analysis) \n",
    "2. Be able to perform EDA on multiple columns (i.e., multivariate analysis)\n",
    "3. Be able to extract insights from visualizations\n",
    "4. Be able to ask critical questions about data\n",
    "5. Be able to estimate a population parameter based on a sample\n",
    "6. Be able to use the bootstrap to quantify the uncertainty of an estimated value\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you can use [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) or PySpark to manipulate data, and use [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) or [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) to make plots. "
